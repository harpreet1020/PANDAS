Given data on schools' budgets and students' standardized test scores, I showcased obvious trends in school performance. To begin, I analyzed district-wide standardized test results for each student and joined this data with school budget data on the 'school_name' column. I then aggregated the data to create the following tables.

### District Summary 

* Created high level of the district's key metrics, including:
    * Total Schools
    * Total Students
    * Total Budget
    * Average Math Score
    * Average Reading Score
    * % Passing Math
    * % Passing Reading
    * Overall Passing Rate

### School Summary 
* Created an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
    * School Name
    * School Type
    * Total Students
    * Total School Budget
    * Per Student Budget
    * Average Math Score
    * Average Reading Score
    * % Passing Math
    * % Passing Reading
    * Overall Passing Rate
    
### Top Performing Schools 
* Created table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate, including:
    * School Name
    * School Type
    * Total Students
    * Total School Budget
    * Per Student Budget
    * Average Math Score
    * Average Reading Score
    * % Passing Math
    * % Passing Reading
    * Overall Passing Rate
    
### Bottom Performing Schools 
* Created table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Includes all of the same metrics as above.

### Math Scores by Grade 
* Created table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade 
* Created table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level at each school.

### Scores by School Spending 
* Created table that breaks down school performaces based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student).

### Scores by School Size 
* Repeated the above breakdown, but based on reasonable apporoximations of school size (small, medium, large).
